# IUST-MicroLab-Assignments
My solutions to IUST's Microprocessor Laboratory assignments, Fall 2021, Mashhoun

Requirements: Proteus, AVR Studio v4 (A01-A03), CodeVisionAVR v2.05.3 (A04-A12)

Microprocessor: ATmega32


## Outline

- Embedded Real-Time Systems and IoT
  - [IoT Sound Level Monitor](https://github.com/ali-sedaghi/IoT-Sound-Level-Monitor)
    - Constructed an Internet of Things (IoT) sound level monitoring device utilizing ESP8266 and an OLED display. The device successfully connected to Wi-Fi networks and transmitted data to the Thingspeak server, enabling real-time monitoring.
  - [SmartRoom ARM STM32](https://github.com/ali-sedaghi/SmartRoom-ARM-STM32)
    - Simulated a smart room environment with a Heater, Cooler, Purifier, and Lock using ARM STM32 microprocessor, programmed in C language, and implemented with Proteus and Keil uVision5.
  - [XO ATmega32](https://github.com/ali-sedaghi/XO-ATmega32)
    - Simulated a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a simple AI opponent using an ATmega32 microcontroller, CodeVisionAVR, and Proteus.
  - [Tinkercad Arduino Calculator](https://github.com/ali-sedaghi/Tinkercad-Arduino-Calculator)
    - Simulated a calculator using Arduino Uno R3, a keypad, and an LCD within the Tinkercad environment.
